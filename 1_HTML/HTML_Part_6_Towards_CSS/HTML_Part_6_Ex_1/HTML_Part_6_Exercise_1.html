    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in
        a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>CSS is designed to <span class="bold">enable the separation of presentation and content</span>, including layout,
        colors, and fonts. This
        separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the
        .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie <span class="italic">on October 10</span>, 1994. At the time, Lie was
        working with Tim Berners-Lee
        at
        CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on
        public
        mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being
        released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is
        regarded as co-creator of CSS.
    </p>

    <h3>Browser support</h3>
    <p>Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent
        between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to
        target
        specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality
        in
        CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support
        for
        many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and <span class="bold">damaged the browser's reputation</span>
        among
        developers.
