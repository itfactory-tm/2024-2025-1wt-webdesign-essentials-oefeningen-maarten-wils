    <h2>A picture says more than a thousand words</h2>
    <p>Images are super important in websites. Reading further or not, often depends on the pictures offered.</p>

    <h3 id="stock">Stock Photos</h3>
    <p>Stock photography is the supply of photographs which are often licensed for specific uses. The stock photo
        industry, which began to gain hold in the 1920s, has established models including traditional macrostock
        photography, midstock photography, and microstock photography. Conventional stock agencies charge from several
        hundred to several thousand US dollars per image, while microstock photography may sell for around US$25 cents.
        Professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a
        contractual basis, while stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers through
        online submission.

    <p>Stock photography refers to the supply of photographs, which are often licensed for specific uses such as
        magazine publishing or pamphlet-making. According to The New York Times, as of 2005 "most" book cover designers
        prefer stock photography agencies over photographers in efforts to save costs. Publishers can then purchase
        photographs on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.</p>

    <h3 id="history">The history of Photography</h3>
    <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically by
        means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is
        employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more
        direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</p>
