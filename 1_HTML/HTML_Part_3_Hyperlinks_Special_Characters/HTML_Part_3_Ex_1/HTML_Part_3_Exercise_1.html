<h1>The "<a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/">Erasmus experience"</a></h1>
<p>More than 9 million people have participated in the Erasmus programme since its creation. The number of young
    participants has increased significantly since 1987. Nearly 300,000 a year compared with only 3,244 in 1987. Spain
    is the country that has allowed most people to participate in Erasmus with more than 40,000 per year, slightly ahead
    of France, Germany and Italy.</p>
