<h1>Design tips</h1>

<div>
    <p>Creating a striped design for a front-end project can add a visually appealing and distinctive touch to your
        website or application. Here are some design tips specific to incorporating stripes in your front-end
        designs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Balance</li>
        <li>Color palette</li>
        <li>Direction</li>
        <li>Spacing</li>
        <li>Typograhy</li>
        <li>Feedback</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Maintain a consistent <span>balance</span> between striped elements and negative space. Ensure that the stripes
        are evenly spaced, and the lines have consistent thickness and alignment throughout your design.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Select a <span>color palette</span> that complements your stripes. Consider using contrasting or complementary
        colors to make the stripes stand out. It's essential to maintain good color contrast for readability and
        aesthetics.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <p>Experiment with different <span>stripe directions</span>. Horizontal stripes can create a calming effect,
        while
        vertical stripes can give the illusion of height. Diagonal or slanted stripes can add energy and movement to
        your design.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Vary the width and <span>spacing </span>of the stripes to add visual interest. You can have thick and thin
        stripes or use irregular spacing to create a unique pattern.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Choose <span>typography</span> that complements the striped design. Ensure that text remains legible against
        the
        striped background by using a sufficient contrast in color or by placing text within solid-colored areas.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Sans serif</span> is highly recommended</li>
        <li><span>Serif</span> in headings is OK</li>
        <li><span>No 'Comic Sans MS'</span></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Always test your striped design with a sample audience and gather <span>feedback</span>. This will help you
        identify any issues and make necessary improvements.</p>
    <p>Remember that the effectiveness of a striped design largely depends on the context and purpose of your
        front-end
        project. Experiment with different styles and approaches to create a unique and visually engaging user
        experience.</p>
