            <h2>The man Thomas More</h2>
            <p>Thomas More was an English Renaissance humanist, lawyer, philosopher and statesman. He became famous for his book Utopia (1516), in which he describes the political system of an ideal non-existent island state. The description of Utopia shows similarities with a socialist salvation state. More used this book to protest against England's economic and political policies. It was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 and is celebrated on June 22.

                <p>More was born on February 7, 1478 in a London bourgeois family. His father was a judge, his mother probably died when More was young. As a teenager he became page of John Morton, the Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury. More enjoyed a good upbringing there and came into contact with a broader culture. After his stay with John Morton More went to Oxford, where he studied artes (fine arts) from 1492 to 1494. After two years he was called back to London by his father to become a lawyer.</p>

                <p>Between 1494 and 1501 More studied law and joined the circles of English humanists such as John Holt, John Colet and William Grocyn. He developed into a versatile humanist and studied the Bible in its original language. Before that he studied the works of the church fathers Jerome and Augustine. In addition More was also taught about the letters of Paul and studied Greek with William Grocyn. In 1499 he then met Erasmus, according to More this was a pivotal point in his life.</p>

                <p>In 1504 More became a member of the English House of Commons. Erasmus often stayed at More's house and wrote there in 1509 the Praise of Folly dedicated to More. More and Erasmus also corresponded extensively with each other. In 1510 More became a judge and shortly afterwards undersheriff of London. In 1511 he remarried Alice Middleton.</p>

                <p>As envoy of King Henry VIII of England he stayed in Bruges in 1515 and also visited Brussels, Mechelen and Antwerp. In 1518 he became a member of the Privy Council and secretary to the king. In 1521 he was elevated to the aristocracy (sir Thomas More) and appointed an undervalued guardian. He led several diplomatic missions. In 1529 he succeeded Thomas Wolsey as lord chancellor and held this post until 1532. More thus became a prominent politician, not only in England, but also in the rest of Europe. He was also a famous humanist and scholar, and was known as a wise and sensitive man.</p>

                <p>In addition to being a lawyer and statesman, Thomas More was also a scientist and writer. He wrote in both English and Latin. Besides his famous work Utopia, he also wrote poems, religious polemics, letters and a historical work.</p>

                <p>In 1886, More was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. His canonization took place on May 19, 1935 (together with that of John Fisher), 400 years after his execution. His feast day was fixed on July 9th. After the Second Vatican Council this date was postponed to June 22, but in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, July 9 is still a public holiday. June 22 is also the holiday of St. John Fisher, the only bishop who remained loyal to the Pope during the English Reformation. 3] In 1980, the Anglican Church added More and Fisher to the list of saints and heroes of the Christian Church with a feast on July 6 (his dying day).</p>

                <p> In the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and South Africa many elementary school and colleges bear the name of Thomas More.</p>

                <p>Since 11 July 2012, the former <span class="bold">Katholieke Hogeschool Kempen, Lessius Antwerpen and Lessius Mechelen</span>, including the De Nayer Institute in Sint-Katelijne-Waver, have formed the integrated Thomas More university college in Flanders. The head office is located in Mechelen.</p>

                <p>From 1 January 2014 the Pabo Thomas More in Rotterdam, separate from Leiden University of Applied Sciences, continued as an independent college under the name Thomas More University of Applied Sciences. The amendment of the law that was necessary for this 'defusion' was adopted in the Lower House on October 17, 2013 and approved by the Upper House on December 3, 2013.</p>

                <p>The current Markland College in Oudenbosch, municipality Halderberge, was called Thomas More College from 1960 to 2004.</p>

                <p>In 1958 the Thomas More College opened its doors in The Hague. After a number of mergers the Terra College came into being, which changed its name after the murder of teacher Van Wieren by a student, and eventually merged into the Scholengroep Den Haag Zuid West under the name of De Haagse VMBO Economie.</p>
